Kyverno (Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩœé, Greek for "govern") is a Kubernetes policy engine and CNCF project that has the ability to validate, mutate, generate, and clean-up resources plus verify OCI container images for supply chain security guarantees--all without requiring any programming language. GitHub is Kyverno's home and here you can find all the interesting things the Kyverno community are working on.
